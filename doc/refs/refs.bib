abstract = {This article demonstrates that over the period 1948-2003, sex differences in mortality in the age range 50-84 widened and then narrowed on a cohort basis rather than on a period basis. The cohort with the maximum excess of male mortality was born shortly after the turn of the century. Three separate data sources suggest that the turnaround in sex mortality differences is consistent with sex differences in cigarette smoking by cohort. An age-period-cohort model reveals a highly significant effect of smoking histories on men's and women's mortality. Combined with recent changes in smoking patterns, the model suggests that sex differences in mortality will narrow dramatically in coming decades.},

abstract = {Trellis display is a framework for the visualization of data. Its most prominent aspect is an overall visual design, reminiscent of a garden trelliswork, in which panels are laid out into rows, columns, and pages. On each panel of the trellis, a subset of the data is graphed by a display method such as a scatterplot, curve plot, boxplot, 3-D wireframe, normal quantile plot, or dot plot. Each panel shows the relationship of certain variables conditional on the values of other variables. A number of display methods employed in the visual design of Trellis display enable it to succeed in uncovering the structure of data even when the structure is quite complicated. For example, Trellis display provides a powerful mechanism for understanding interactions in studies of how a response depends on explanatory variables. Three examples demonstrate this; in each case, we make important discoveries not appreciated in the original analyses. Several control methods are also essential to Trellis display. A control method is a technique for specifying information so that a display can be drawn. The control methods of Trellis display form a basic conceptual framework that can be used in designing software. We have demonstrated the viability of the control methods by implementing them in the S/S-PLUS system for graphics and data analysis, but they can be implemented in any software system with a basic capability for drawing graphs.},

abstract = {Graphic methods in demography date back tb 1669. When Christian Huygens plotted the survival function of the life table in order to calculate mean and median expectations of life at different ages. In this paper, the authors discuss the principal graphic methods which have been used in demographic analysis since Huygens time. During the first half of the nineteenth century, J.B. Fourier and A. Quetelet used graphic methods efficiently, to help in an understanding and synthesis of demographic phenomena. Between 1860 and 1880, a number of authors (Berg, Knapp, Zeuner, Becker, Lexis and Lewin) tried to solve the problem of plotting demographic data in three dimensions by age, period and cohort. Their efforts resulted on one hand in the famous Lexis diagram, and on the other in stereograms, of which those by Perozzo were warmly received, and which are briefly described here. Finally, the authors present the recent method of contour maps as a representation of demographic surfaces, which make it possible for the reader to look at age, period and cohort simultaneously.},

However, the male: female prevalence ratio is markedly different in Europeans and Asians.

Since color vision is three-dimensional, this provides three additional perceptual dimensions that may be used in addition to the two spatial dimensions available on a flat display to present multidimensional data. This research probes the usefulness of color in enabling human observers to perceive clusters of points in a multidimensional space. Comparing the resolution of clusters in color and in space shows that color is an effective extension of space for conveying information about data dimensions. However, the perceptual space defined by color and space is not homogeneous and resolution is poor in a few specific directions. For this reason, the use of multiple views is advocated whenever color is used as a too in exploratory data analysis.},

@book{Willekens2014,
abstract = {This book provides an introduction to multistate event history analysis. It is an extension of survival analysis, in which a single terminal event (endpoint) is considered and the time-to-event is studied. Multistate models focus on life histories or trajectories, conceptualized as sequences of states and sequences of transitions between states. Life histories are modeled as realizations of continuous-time Markov processes. The model parameters, transition rates, are estimated from data on event counts and populations at risk, using the statistical theory of counting processes. The Comprehensive R Network Archive (CRAN) includes several packages for multistate modeling. This book is about Biograph. The package is designed to (a) enhance exploratory analysis of life histories and (b) make multistate modeling accessible. The package incorporates utilities that connect to several packages for multistate modeling, including survival, eha, Epi, mvna, etm, mstate, msm, and TraMineR for sequence analysis. The book is a ‘hands-on' presentation of Biograph and the packages listed. It is written from the perspective of the user. To help the user master the techniques and the software, a single data set is used to illustrate the methods and software. It is the subsample of the German Life History Survey, which was also used by Blossfeld and Rohwer in their popular textbook on event history modeling. Another data set, the Netherlands Family and Fertility Survey, is used to illustrate how Biograph can assist in answering questions on life paths of cohorts and individuals. The book is suitable as a textbook for graduate courses on event history analysis and introductory courses on competing risks and multistate models. It may also be used as a self-study book. The R code used in the book is available online. Frans Willekens is affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) in Rostock, Germany. He is Emeritus Professor of Demography at the University of Groningen, a Honorary Fellow of the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI) in the Hague, and a Research Associate of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Laxenburg, Austria.

Cependant, on a constat{\'{e}} depuis longtemps que si l'on compare la moyenne, pour plusieurs ann{\'{e}}es cons{\'{e}}cutives, des taux de mortalit{\'{e}} {\`{a}} une moyenne analogue calcul{\'{e}}e trente ou cinquante ans auparavant, on observe habituellement une diminution de la mortalit{\'{e}}; c'est le ph{\'{e}}nom{\`{e}}ne g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ralement d{\'{e}}sign{\'{e}} sous le nom de baisse de la mortalit{\'{e}}. Dans une communication que nous a$\backslash$ons faite {\`{a}} la Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} de Statistique il y a quatre — 184 — .ans (1), nous avons montr{\'{e}}, au moyen des surfaces de mortalit{\'{e}} de la France, qu'il existait une variation continue de la mortalit{\'{e}} suivant l'{\'{e}}poque et l'{\^{a}}ge que l'on pouvait d{\'{e}}signer sous le nom d'{\'{e}}volution de la mortalit{\'{e}}. Nous avions constat{\'{e}} qu'il existait des diff{\'{e}}rences importantes entre l'{\'{e}}volution de la mortalit{\'{e}} des hommes et celle des femmes en France, mais sans avoir d'{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}ment de comparaison permettant de dire si ces diff{\'{e}}rences {\'{e}}taient normales ou anormales. Nous allons donner cet {\'{e}}l{\'{e}}ment de comparaison par l'{\'{e}}tude de la mortalit{\'{e}} dans les dix pays d'Europe ayant des statistiques de mortalit{\'{e}} suffisamment anciennes et pr{\'{e}}-cises pour permettre de former les surfaces de mortalit{\'{e}}. Ces pays sont : outre la France depuis 1817, la Su{\`{e}}de depuis 1751, la Norv{\`{e}}ge depuis 1801, le Danemark depuis 1802, l'Angleterre depuis 1838, les Pays-Bas depuis 1840, la Finlande depuis 1866, l'Allemagne depuis 1871, l'Italie depuis 1876 et la Suisse depuis 1876 {\'{e}}galement. Nous avons cherch{\'{e}} {\`{a}} r{\'{e}}unir tous les documents et sp{\'{e}}cialement les documents anciens sur la mortalit{\'{e}} suivant le sexe et l'{\^{a}}ge de l'ensemble de la population de ces dix pays. Nous nous sommes efforc{\'{e}}, par tous les moyens possibles, de rendre utilisables et aussi comparables que nous l'avons pu ces documents, car il nous semble du plus haut int{\'{e}}r{\^{e}}t de faire commencer le plus anciennement possible l'{\'{e}}poque historique de la d{\'{e}}mographie : tous ces documents anciens sont l'expression d'une {\'{e}}volution pass{\'{e}}e de la mortalit{\'{e}} dont la p{\'{e}}riode contemporaine n'est que la cons{\'{e}}quence (2).},

abstract = {Any matrix of rank two can be displayed as a biplot which consists of a vector for each row and a vector for each column, chosen so that any element of the matrix is exactly the inner product of the vectors corresponding to its row and to its column. If a matrix is of higher rank, one may display it approximately by a biplot of a matrix of rank two which approximates the original matrix. The biplot provides a useful tool of data analysis and allows the visual appraisal of the structure of large data matrices. It is especially revealing in principal component analysis, where the biplot can show inter-unit distances and indicate clustering of units as well as display variances and correlations of the variables.},

@article{Vandeschrick2001,
abstract = {Around 1870, demographers felt the need for a simple chart to present population dynamics. This chart is known as the Lexis diagram, but it is a misnomer. To be useful, this chart must allow for the systematic location on one plane of the three classical demographic co-ordinates, namely: the date, the age and the moment of birth. There are three solutions for this problem. In 1869, Zeuner worked out a first solution. In 1870, Brasche proposed a second one with networks of parallels; it is the version most currently used now. In 1874, Becker proposed the third one. In 1875, certainly after Verwey, Lexis took back Zeuner's diagram and just added networks of parallels. In spite of all this, the name "Lexis diagram" has imposed itself in a seemingly invincible way.},

abstract = {The singular value decomposition and its interpretation as a linear biplot have proved to be a powerful tool for analysing many forms of multivariate data. Here we adapt biplot meth- odology to the specific case of compositional data consisting of positive vectors each of which is constrained to have unit sum. These relative variation biplots have properties relating to the special features of compositional data: the study of ratios, subcompositions and models of compositional relationships. The methodology is applied to a data set consisting of six-part col- our compositions in 22 abstract paintings, showing how the singular value decomposition can achieve an accurate biplot of the colour ratios and how possible models interrelating the colours can be diagnosed.},

@article{Cleveland1984,
abstract = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

@article{Beltran-Sanchez2015,
abstract = {Using historical data from 1,763 birth cohorts from 1800 to 1935 in 13 developed countries, we show that what is now seen as normal—a large excess of female life expectancy in adulthood—is a demographic phenomenon that emerged among people born in the late 1800s. We show that excess adult male mortality is clearly rooted in specific age groups, 50–70, and that the sex asymmetry emerged in cohorts born after 1880 when male:female mortality ratios increased by as much as 50{\%} from a baseline of about 1.1. Heart disease is the main condition associated with increased excess male mortality for those born after 1900. We further show that smoking-attributable deaths account for about 30{\%} of excess male mortality at ages 50–70 for cohorts born in 1900–1935. However, after accounting for smoking, substantial excess male mortality at ages 50–70 remained, particularly from cardiovascular disease. The greater male vulnerability to cardiovascular conditions emerged with the reduction in infectious mortality and changes in health-related behaviors.},

@article{Eyton1984,
abstract = {Complementary color coding is used in conjunction with nontraditional legend ar- rangements to create two-variable maps. The logic of a complementary color-coding scheme is simpler and easier for the map user to comprehend than the spectrally encoded scheme used to produce most of the two-variable maps published to date. In addition to the complementary color-coding scheme, an unclassed legend based on a line of best fit and a legend arrangement based on the binormal distribution are used to represent more accurately the structure of the bivariate scatter diagram. These legends avoid many of the statistical distortions introduced by the rectangular legend currently being used to produce two-variable maps. Although the un- classed two-variable map presents a true graphic correlation, the large number of color tones contained in the map confounds the map user. The two-variable map based on the binormal distribution combines the rectangular legend and an equiprobability ellipse to represent the legend diagonal. This appears to be a good compromise for the production of complementary- color, two-variable maps.},
