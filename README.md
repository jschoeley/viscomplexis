Visualizing Compositional Data on the Lexis Surface
===================================================

by *Jonas Sch√∂ley* and *Frans Willekens*

Background
----------

The Lexis surface plot is an established visualization tool in demography. Its present utility however is limited to the domain of 1-dimensional magnitudes like rates and counts.

Contribution
------------

We extend the Lexis surface plot to the domain of compositional data. We introduce, demonstrate, evaluate and compare four techniques for visualizing group compositions on an age-period grid.

Methods
-------

To demonstrate the techniques we use publicly available data on age-specific cause of death compositions in France from 1925 to 1999. We compare the visualizations for compliance with multiple desired criteria.

Results
-------

Compositional data can be visualized on the Lexis surface. The key feature of the classical Lexis surface plot -- to show cohort-, period- and age patterns in the data -- is retained in the domain of compositional data. The optimal choice of technique depends mainly on the number of groups in the compositional data.
