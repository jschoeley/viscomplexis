Visualizing Compositional Data on the Lexis Surface
===================================================

by *Jonas Sch√∂ley* and *Frans Willekens*

Background
----------

The analysis of compositional data is a topic inherent to demography. In recent times, due to a growing catalogue of detailed population data, it became feasible to consider populations not only structured by time, age or sex, but by any number of interesting criteria. This \enquote{inflation} of data dimensions produces challenges in visualizing the data.

Objective
---------

To aid the understanding of age-structured timelines of compositions we seek to extend the Lexis surface plot from 1-dimensional continuous data to multidimensional compositional data.

Methods
-------

We propose four different techniques for visualizing compositional data on the Lexis surface and apply them to French death counts given by cause. We compare the visualizations for compliance with multiple desired criteria.

Results
-------

Composite data can be visualized on the Lexis surface. The key feature of the classical Lexis surface plot -- to show cohort-, period- and age patterns in the data -- is retained in the domain of compositional data. The optimal choice of technique depends mainly on the number of groups in the compositional data.
